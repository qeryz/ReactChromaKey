# Chroma Key Compositing
 Interactive web page in which a user can upload any green screen image/video and a background image, which then produces an output replacing the green screen object with the desired background.
By combining the capabilities of the [`video`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element with a [`canvas`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas), it allows us to manipulate video data in real time.

## The document content
The main lines to note from the HTML document:
 <!DOCTYPE html>
          <p> <canvas id = "c1" width="1920" height = "1080"></canvas> </p> 
          <p> <canvas id = "c2" width="1920" height = "1080"></canvas> </p>
    </div>

    <script src="./app.js"></script>
 </html>
 Two key points:
 
1.  This document creates two [`canvas`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) elements, with the IDs `c1` and `c2`.  Canvas `c1` is used to display the current frame of the original video, while `c2` is used to display the video after performing the chroma-key algorithm; `c2` is to be preloaded with a still image from the user that will be used to replace the green background in the video.
2.  The JavaScript code is imported from a script named `app.js`.

## The JavaScript code

The JavaScript code in `app.js` consists of 8 functions.

### Dimensions Safety Check, Clear Canvas

The `checkDimensions()` function is a simple safety check to ensure the background image is at least as big as the foreground image (this check does not run for video files as the background image will simply repeat if not large enough for the foreground).
The code is as follows: 


```js
    function checkDimensions(){
      if (image2.getWidth() < image1.getWidth()){
        alert("Please select a background image that is bigger in width and height than the foreground image.");
        return false;
      }
      else{
        alert("Success!");
        return true;
      }
    }      
```
The `clearCanvas()` function is trivial, it simply clears canvas c1 and c2 and resets formatting of the page.


### Initializing the chroma-key player

The `doLoad()` method is called when a user-uploaded video initially loads. This method's function is to prepare the variables needed by the chroma-key processing code, and to set up two event listeners so we can detect when the user starts playing the video or when the video loads on upload.

```js
    doLoad: function() {
      this.video = document.querySelector('#video');

      this.c1 = document.querySelector('#c1');
      this.ctx1 = this.c1.getContext("2d");

      this.c2 = document.querySelector('#c2');
      this.ctx2 = this.c2.getContext("2d");

      let self = this;

      this.video.addEventListener('play', function(){
        self.width = self.video.videoWidth;
        self.height = self.video.videoHeight;
        self.timerCallback();
      });

      this.video.addEventListener('loadeddata', function(){
        self.width = self.video.videoWidth;
        self.height = self.video.videoHeight;
        self.timerCallback();
      });
    },      
```

This code grabs references to the elements in the HTML document that are of our interest, namely the `video` element and the two `canvas` elements.  It also fetches references to the graphics contexts for each of the two canvases.  These will be used when we're actually doing the chroma-keying effect.

Then `addEventListener()` is called to begin watching the `video` element so that we obtain notification when the user presses the play button on the video or the other `addEventListener()` is called to begin watching whne the user initiallyl loads the uploaded video.  In response to the user beginning playback, this code fetches the width and height of the video, then calls the `timerCallback()` method to start watching the video and processing the effect.

### The timer callback

The timer callback is called initially when the video starts playing (when the "play" event occurs or when the content loads), then takes responsibility for establishing itself to be called periodically in order to launch the keying effect for each frame.

```js
    timerCallback: function() {
      if (this.video.paused || this.video.ended) {
        return;
      }
      this.computeFrame();
      let self = this;
      setTimeout(function(){
          self.timerCallback();
      }, 0);
    },
```

The first thing the callback does is check to see if the video is even playing; if it's not, the callback returns immediately without doing anything.

Then it calls the `computeFrame()` method, which performs the chroma-keying effect on the current video frame.

The last thing the callback does is call `setTimeout()` to schedule itself to be called again as soon as possible.  In the real world, you would probably schedule this to be done based on knowledge of the video's frame rate.

### Manipulating a video frame data

The `computeFrame()` method, shown below, is responsible for actually fetching a frame of data and performing the chroma-keying effect.

```js
    computeFrame: function() {
      this.ctx1.drawImage(this.video, 0, 0, this.width, this.height);
      let frame = this.ctx1.getImageData(0, 0, this.width, this.height);
      let l = frame.data.length / 4;
  
      for (let i = 0; i < l; i++){
        let r = frame.data[i * 4 + 0];
        let g = frame.data[i * 4 + 1];
        let b = frame.data[i * 4 + 2];
        if (g > r + b) {
          frame.data[i * 4 + 3] = 0;
        }
      }
      this.ctx2.putImageData(frame, 0, 0);
    }
```

When this routine is called, the video element is displaying the most recent frame of video data, which looks like this:

![](video.png)

In line 2, that frame of video is copied into the graphics context `ctx1` of the first canvas, specifying as the height and width the values we previously set.  Note that you can pass the video element into the context's `drawImage()` method to draw the current video frame into the context.

Line 3 fetches a copy of the raw graphics data for the current frame of video by calling the `getImageData()` method on the first context.  This provides raw 32-bit pixel image data we can then manipulate.  Line 4 computes the number of pixels in the image by dividing the total size of the frame's image data by four.

The `for` loop that begins on line 6 scans through the frame's pixels, pulling out the red, green, and blue values for each pixel, and compares the values against predetermined numbers that are used to detect the green screen that will be replaced with the still background image imported.

Every pixel in the frame's image data that is found that is within the parameters that are considered to be part of the green screen has its alpha value replaced with a zero, indicating that the pixel is entirely transparent.  As a result, the final image has the entire green screen area 100% transparent, so that when it's drawn into the destination context in line 14, the result is an overlay onto the static backdrop.

The resulting image looks like this:

![](output.png)

This is done repeatedly as the video plays, so that frame after frame is processed and displayed with the chroma-key effect.
